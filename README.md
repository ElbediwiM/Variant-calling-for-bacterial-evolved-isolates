# Variant-calling-for-bacterial-evolved-isolates
Genomic analysis of evolved Salmonella Typhimurium isolates  with colisitin antibiotic

Project Overview
This project involves the genomic analysis of Salmonella Typhimurium isolates obtained from an experimental evolution study with colistin antibiotic. The isolates were collected over 68 days, starting from day 1. The reference genome used for this analysis is Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028.

Data
The raw data consists of 68 FASTQ files, each representing a single isolate. The files are named in the format 1_FDSW202409576-1r.clean.fq, 2_FDSW202409577-1r.clean.fq, ..., 68_FDSW202409643-1r.clean.fq.

Pipeline
The pipeline used for this analysis includes the following steps:

Quality Control (QC): FastQC and MultiQC are used to assess the quality of the raw reads.
Alignment: BWA-MEM is used to align the trimmed reads to the reference genome (ATCC 14028).
BAM Processing: SAMtools and Picard are used to sort, mark duplicates, and index the BAM files.
Variant Calling: BCFtools is used to call variants from the BAM files.
VCF Processing: BCFtools is used to filter and normalize the VCF files.
VCF Merging: BCFtools is used to merge the individual VCF files into a single VCF file.
Annotation : SnpEff is used to annotate the variants in the merged VCF file.
Software Requirements
The following software tools are required for this analysis:

FastQC
MultiQC
fastp
BWA
SAMtools
Picard
BCFtools
SnpEff (optional)

Output Files
The following output files are generated by the pipeline:

fastqc/multiqc_report.html: Summary of raw read quality.
aligned/*_dedup.bam: Final BAM files after duplicate marking.
variants/all_isolates.vcf: Merged VCF file containing variants across all isolates.
variants/all_isolates.annotated.vcf: Annotated VCF with functional predictions (if annotation is performed).
